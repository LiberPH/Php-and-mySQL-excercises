Follow up of a course to create a social network on Udemy

## Step 1
Download a virtual server to use for trials on PhP
- The suggested virtual server is XAMMP https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
- htdocs is the folder that should be used to save the php files
-Suggested code ditors:
  - Sulime text
  - brackets (web design)
  - atom
## Step 2 Tutorial on PhP
- In PHP always start the name of variable with a letter (not with a number) and do not use special characters on them (see variables.php in the folder tutorials).
- PhP accepts html code in the echo calls
-Contants can be defined in the following way in PhP: define("Frida","pinta")
-PhP has operators that compare if two variables are equal (or diferent and the same kind of data
 - === equal and same kind of data (float, int, etc)
 - !== different and/or different kind of data
 - <> same as !=
 - Increase (++) works slightly different in pHp than in other languages (see incement_decrement.php).
